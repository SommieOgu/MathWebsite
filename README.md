Website to visualize polynomials

To test out a stable, hard-coded demo, please download **WorkingMathDisplayExample.html**, **vertexExample.html**, or **2by2example.html**. You may need to try a different browser if it doesn't work at first — since this is our first time coding in JavaScript (or developing anything, really), we may have relied on some dependencies that aren't present everywhere.

If you have VSCode, we recommend using that. You may wish to try opening it using this extension, which we used while coding these no-input demos:

**To test out the entire website**, please note you will need XAMPP. **Download the entire folder and run it.**
